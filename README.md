The app was created primarily for the iPhone Pro Max 11 (414x896) without adaptation for desktops. 

The pixel style mini app was developed as a commercial order for which no materials, specifications or ideas were provided. The deadline was 10 days of which most of the time was spent on the idea, design, search and creation of pictures and gif-animations. The functionality of the application is pretty simple, the initial frame with the validation of the password and then gives access to a carousel of different images, animations and stylizations. I tried to make the most creative application with an interesting idea and design in an extremely short period of time. If the idea and the message of the app is not clear, it characterizes the client's girl Annie with different living and non-living objects, abstractions, places and phenomena.
